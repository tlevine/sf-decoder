            The Department of Public Health shall establish and maintain a register identifying those persons who wish to be visited after a major earthquake or other
disaster which poses a threat of injury to such persons. The persons eligible to register are those 65 years of age or older, those who are disabled, and those who
employ or house persons who are eligible to register. A "disabled person" is one whose life functions have been significantly altered by their medical condition or
disease, or who has any other significantly disabling physical, or mental condition including, but not limited to, a physical condition that significantly impairs his or her ability to move normally, a chronic illness that requires continuing medication to prevent a life-threatening disease, or a condition (such as heart disease) that could result in a serious medical problem in a disaster. Persons who wish to be included in the register shall provide their name, address, telephone number and the
names, addresses and telephone numbers of any relatives, neighbors, or other persons who regularly communicate with the person registered and may be able to
provide information as to that person's condition in the event of a disaster. In the event of a major earthquake or other disaster which poses a threat of injury to
senior and disabled persons, the Department shall attempt to visit or otherwise communicate with registered persons in order to determine if they need medical or
other assistance. The Department shall act as expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration the need to allocate resources to respond to the disaster. The
Department shall provide notice to the public that registration is available by such means as the Department determines best suited to reach seniors and the
disabled.
